<p>This task showcases a neat program developed in C-language that allows users to calculate the sum of integers at varying scales. The code itself can be executed via GCC syntax where you can generate the output via ./a.out.

In addition, there is another version of the code available which uses RISC-V architecture, however this does implement two of its own optimization strategies which include: -O1 and -Ofast.<br> 
### What is -O1 and -Ofast?
> * -O1: As this strategy encompasses a range of radical transformations and changesâ€¦the volume of generated assembly code is quite large.<br> 
> * -Ofast:The strategy shifts its main focus to increased speed around and turns on the more robust performance modifications which would ultimately produce less assembly code.

In order to achieve the best possible performance and assemble code -O1 is your best shot. But, if you wish to complete the task in the shortest span of time possible then Ofast will prove to be valuable.
