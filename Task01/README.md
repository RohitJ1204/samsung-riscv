## C program which calculates sum of numbers from 1 to 100
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i, sum=0,n=100;
    for(i=2; i<=n; i+=2)
    {
	sum += i;
    }

    printf("Sum of all even number between 1 to %d = %d\n", n, sum);

    return 0;
}

```
## Compilation of C-Code using gcc command 
```
gcc sumeven2ton.c
./a.out
```
## RISCV Command
```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum_1ton.o sum_1ton.c
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum_1ton.o sum_1ton.c
```
### What is -O1 and -Ofast?
> * -O1: As this strategy encompasses a range of radical transformations and changesâ€¦the volume of generated assembly code is quite large.<br> 
> * -Ofast:The strategy shifts its main focus to increased speed around and turns on the more robust performance modifications which would ultimately produce less assembly code.

In order to achieve the best possible performance and assemble code -O1 is your best shot. But, if you wish to complete the task in the shortest span of time possible then Ofast will prove to be valuable.
